    "introduction": {
      "paragraph1": "The seaport industry is the \"lifeblood\" of global trade and an indispensable link in international supply chains. With increasing cargo volumes and pressure for speed and accuracy, seaports are no longer static docks but complex operational ecosystems that dictate the pace of an entire economy.",
      "imageAlt": "Introduction to the Seaport Industry",
      "paragraph2": "In Vietnam, with its strategic geographic position, the seaport system is a key driver of economic growth. However, the industry faces significant challenges with hinterland connectivity and high logistics costs, requiring a revolution in operational management to enhance competitiveness."

    "challenges": {
      "title": "Real-World Challenges in the Seaport Industry",
      "description": "Seaports operating traditionally face persistent \"bottlenecks\" that hinder development in the digital era:",

      "challenge1": {
        "title": "Fragmented Data and \"Data Silos\"",
        "description": "This is the biggest challenge. Cargo information may reside in sales team emails, ship schedules in separate software, and vehicle gate records manually logged.",
        "impact": "This lack of connectivity creates an operational environment where no one has a holistic view, leading to delayed and inefficient decisions."
      },
      "challenge2": {
        "title": "Lack of Real-Time Holistic View",
        "description": "The direct consequence is that management cannot quickly answer critical operational questions like: \"Which berth is available?\", \"Where are trucks congested?\", or \"What is the current loading/unloading productivity?\". Decisions often rely on experience or delayed reports."
      },
      "challenge3": {
        "title": "Poor Operational Efficiency and Prolonged Congestion",
        "description": "Without synchronized data, efficiency drops inevitably. Ships wait longer to berth, trucks queue outside gates due to manual paperwork, and equipment allocation is suboptimal, leading to waste and reduced competitiveness."
      },
      "challenge4": {
        "title": "Safety, Security, and Human Error Risks",
        "description": "Manual operations pose high risks to workplace safety and security. Lax access control and slow incident response (e.g., fires) are persistent issues. Reliance on paperwork increases human error risks, causing financial and cargo losses."
