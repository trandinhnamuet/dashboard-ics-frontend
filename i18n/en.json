    "introduction": {
      "paragraph1": "The seaport industry serves as the \"lifeblood\" of global trade and a critical link in international supply chains. With increasing cargo volumes and demands for speed and accuracy, seaports are no longer static docks but complex operational ecosystems driving the pace of entire economies.",
      "imageAlt": "Introduction to the Seaport Industry",
      "paragraph2": "In Vietnam, with its strategic geographic position, the seaport system is a key driver of economic growth. However, the industry faces significant challenges in hinterland connectivity and high logistics costs, necessitating a revolution in operational management to enhance competitiveness."

        "description": "This is the greatest challenge. Shipment information may reside in sales team emails, vessel schedules in separate software, and gate entry/exit data recorded manually.",

        "description": "As a direct consequence, management cannot quickly answer critical operational questions like: \"Which berth is available?\", \"Where are trucks congested?\", or \"What is the current cargo handling productivity?\" Decisions are often based on experience or delayed reports."

      "challenge3": {
        "title": "Low Operational Efficiency and Prolonged Congestion",
        "description": "Without synchronized data, efficiency declines are inevitable. Vessels wait longer to berth, trucks queue outside gates due to manual paperwork, and equipment allocation is suboptimal. This causes waste, increases costs, and severely reduces competitiveness."

        "title": "Safety, Security, and Human Error Risks",
